# My Personal Project

##  Productivity Management Application:


### `Proposal: `

My proposal for my term project is to create a productivity management application.This objective of this application\
is to **boost** productivity for students by offering features that enable good study habits. 

As of right now, I envision the following features for the application: 
- A timer
- A calendar
- Sticky notes

**Note that the above list is simply a tentative list of features**

This project is interesting to me as I frequently use productivity applications such as *Trello*, *Notion*, or *Forest*\
to support my own productivity and I would like to try and implement the features from those applications that I love\
in my term project.
