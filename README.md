# My Personal Project

##  Movie/TV Show List Application:


### `Proposal: `

My proposal for my term project is to create an application that allows the user to log TV shows or movies they are \
watching. The most basic objective for this application is to allow to organize TV shows or Movies into lists such as \
*"planning to watch"*, *"currently watching"*, *"dropped"*, *etc*.

As of right now, I envision the following additional features for the application: 
- A timer that counts down how long until the release date of a TV Show or Movie
- The ability for the user to provide ratings for a TV show or Movie
- Visualization of the users score distribution across all TV shows/Movies logged in their account

**Note that the above list is simply a tentative list of features**

This project is interesting to me as I like using services such as *myAnimeList*, or *aniList* and I would like to try\
and take the best features that I love from those services and try to implement them myself in my application.

## User Stories:
- As a user, I would like to add Movies and TV shows to a Movie watchlist
- As a user, I would like to be able to add a rating for my TV shows and Movies
- As a user, I would like to keep track and organize different lists of Movies and TV shows such as a \
*currently watching*, *planning to watch*, or *dropped* list
- As a user, I would like to have the Movie and TV shows in my list to be sorted in descending order by rating
