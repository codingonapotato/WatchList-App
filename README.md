# My Personal Project

##  WatchList Application:


### `Proposal: `

My proposal for my term project is to create an application that allows the user to log TV shows or movies they are \
watching. The most basic objective for this application is to allow to organize TV shows or Movies into lists such as \
*"planning to watch"*, *"currently watching"*, *"dropped"*, *etc*.

As of right now, I envision the following additional features for the application:
- The ability for the user to provide ratings for a TV show or Movie
- The ability to perform basic statistics on across ratings in a Watchlist

This project is interesting to me as I like using services such as *myAnimeList*, or *aniList* and I would like to try\
and take the best features that I love from those services and try to implement them myself in my application.
